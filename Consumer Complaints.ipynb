      "Enter compliant: I became past due on my Discover Credit Card last year. In an effort to remedy the situation I agreed to allow Discover to automatically debit my checking account in the amount of {$140.00} for 6 months. In exchange for allowing this to take place, Discover agreed to credit the monthly interest and late fees for the 6 month period, place a one time credit on my account of {$700.00} at the end of the 6 month period, and to \" re-age '' my account with the credit bureau so that the previously reported delinquent payment would be removed. This arrangement started on XXXX XXXX, 2015. After making the 6 on-time payments, Discover has informed me that they do n't have notes showing me the {$700.00} payment promise. However, they do have notes on my account that reflect the promise to re-age my account, but they refuse to do so with the XXXX major credit bureaus. After requesting that the recorded call from XXXX 2015 be located, I was informed that they were unable to do that. However, they would likely be able to get the call if required by the legal process.   I 'm writing this complaint because it 's really disappointing that a financial company promises to do something, the consumer attempts to correct a wrong, and then the financial company does n't uphold their end of the bargain. I feel as if Discover took advantage of my willingness to pay and made promises they never intended to keep.\n",
